# Music-Popularity-Prediction
This project predicts song popularity using machine learning on 227 tracks. A Random Forest model identified key features like acousticness and release year, offering insights for the music industry.
# 🎵 Music Popularity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the popularity of songs based on audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, and acousticness using a Random Forest Regressor model.

## 📁 Dataset
- 227 songs with musical features and metadata
- Target variable: Popularity score

## 🧪 Workflow
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Regression using Random Forest
- Evaluation with MSE and R² score

## 📊 Results
- Acousticness and release year were key predictors
- Model shows strong potential for predicting music popularity

# 🎵 Music Popularity Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts song popularity using features like tempo, acousticness, and energy with a Random Forest model trained on 227 tracks.

##  Dataset
- File: `Spotify_data.csv`
- Contains song metadata and musical features
- Target: Popularity score

##  ML Model
- Model: Random Forest Regressor
- Metrics: Mean Squared Error, R² Score
- Top Features: Acousticness, Release Year

##  How to Run
1. Open `AIML_PROJECT.ipynb`
2. Upload `Spotify_data.csv` when prompted
3. Run cells to train and evaluate the model

##  Output
- Feature importance graph at the end
- Insights for music industry use cases
